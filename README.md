CSS / JS Hash Fix for Magento 

## Overview
A simple module fix for Magento CSS / JS Merging. Instead of just using the files to do the hash against (which means it would re-generate with the same filenames, it now uses filemtime against each file)

## Changelog
### Version 1.0.0
* Added in base module
* Supports handling the filename for JS and CSS
